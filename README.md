I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CODE, I MADE EDITS TO THE ORIGINAL GAME CODE, IT IS ALL FOR FUN!


**Instructions:**

1. Save the Assembly-CSharp.dll gamefil
2. right click on the "Welcome To The Game II" on steam.
3. Select Properties and go to "Open Game Files"
4. In the WTTG/Managed folder there should be an already existing "Assembly-CSharp.dll".
5. Delete that file and replace it with the one downloaded here.
